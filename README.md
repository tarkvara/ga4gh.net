# ga4gh.net
## .NET bindings for the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) API

Details of the GA4GH API are at https://ga4gh-schemas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Currently based on version 0.6.0a10 of the GA4GH .proto files.

The .NET bindings were generated with [NSwag](http://nswag.org), and modified to make the code backwards-compatible with version 0.6.0a7 of the API.

Includes sample mobile apps for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Droid.
